        Hello, I'm John-Paul Walker, a passionate and self-motivated software
        developer. This portfolio serves as a showcase of the skills I've
        acquired during my time at Northcoders, a renowned coding bootcamp known
        for its comprehensive curriculum and rigorous training.

      <p className="about-text">
        At Northcoders, I have gained in-depth knowledge of modern web
        development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
        Through extensive hands-on projects and collaborative coding exercises,
        I have honed my problem-solving abilities and developed a strong
        foundation in building scalable and efficient web applications.

      <p className="about-text">
        Beyond my time at Northcoders, I have been dedicated to continuous
        learning, further expanding my skill set and staying up-to-date with
        industry trends. Through self-study and personal projects, I have
        delved into backend development using Node.js and Express, as well as
        database technologies such as MongoDB and PostgreSQL.
